# Fuwa 不和
Use emojis, stickers and themes for free on a "certain popular Voice, Video and Chat platform". Use the emoji and sticker selector to send them. 
Keep in mind that you cannot use the emojis inserted in text and that you cannot send them using the `:emoji:` shortcut. 
Under `Appearance` in `Settings` you can select a theme that you would like to apply, you can also preview it before applying it.

# Is it save to use?
**No**, using this script or any other programs that modify the original Application is **against the TOS** and could lead to a ban of your account. 
**Use this script at your own risk!**

# Installation
## Linux
Follow the instructions as listed below if you are running a linux system (should work on windows too, if required packages are installed).
Keep in mind that the app has to be closed before starting `main.py`.
```
git clone http://github.com/danielfvm/Fuwa
cd Fuwa
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Windows
Download the `.zip` file from releases, extract it and start the executable `Fuwa.exe`. It should start the app automatically with
the script applied. Make sure that the app was not running, otherwise it will only open the already started program, wihout the script being applied.

# How it works?
This works by injecting the `script.js` file into the app which can detect if a user clicks on an emoji that has been disabled. 
When clicking on the emoji, the url of the image is being send to the python script which uses the Keyboard to write the URL into the
message box and then sends it.

# Why is there a webserver running in the py script?
I was not able to send the url of the emoji directly from the injected script. If you know a way how to insert and send a text into the
chat box, please feel free to make a pull request.

# Dependencies
This project makes use of code from the [electron-inject](https://github.com/tintinweb/electron-inject) project for injecting the `script.js` 
file into App (See `injector.py`).
